# MuscleHub-A-B-Test

Currently, when a visitor to MuscleHub is considering buying a membership, he or she follows the following steps:\
-Take a fitness test with a personal trainer\
-Fill out an application for the gym\
-Send in their payment for their first monthâ€™s membership

Visitors will randomly be assigned to one of two groups:\
-Group A will still be asked to take a fitness test with a personal trainer\
-Group B will skip the fitness test and proceed directly to the application

Analyze the data in order to test the hypothesis that visitors assigned to Group B will be more likely to eventually purchase a membership to MuscleHub

Step 1: Investigate the Data\
Step 2: Mapping the Data\
Step 3: Plotting the Data\
